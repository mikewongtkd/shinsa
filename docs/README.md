# ShinSa

ShinSa is software that implements the Kukkiwon Taekwondo dan/poom promotion
examination specification as an easy-to-use portable web application. 

## Examination Criteria

Kukkiwon recognizes four areas of study within Taekwondo, with a fifth area in
progress. The four areas are: (1) *kibon*, basic techniques; (2) *poomsae*,
demonstration of forms that contain quintessential movements of Taekwondo; (3)
*gyeorugi*, demonstration of sport combat; and (4) *kyukpa*, demonstration of
power and technique by breaking objects such as wooden boards, cement bricks,
etc. A fifth area, *hosinsul* or self-defense techniques, has been proposed and
may be included at a later unspecified date.

Kukkiwon has defined guidelines to score these four areas of study, which shall
be discussed in greater detail below. For full details, see [1]. 

In addition to the four areas of study, Kukkiwon requires factual understanding
of Taekwondo, demonstrated by one or more of the following methods: (1) a
written exam; (2) original research or exposition of relevant personal
experience; (3) interview.
